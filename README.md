# React + Webpack Boilerplate
This boilerplate is heavily based on the [Getting started with webpack and React, ES6 style](http://humaan.com/getting-started-with-webpack-and-react-es6-style/) article on the Humaan blog, along with my own personal customizations and preferences.

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/drewrawitz/react-webpack-boilerplate.git
cd react-webpack-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8080
```

## In use:
- React
- webpack
- Sass
- Babel
- ES6 syntax
- hot module loaders
